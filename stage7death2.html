	<h5>What's explify? You look around and find a dictionary on a nearby bookshelf. There is one problem: Not only does the word explify not exist in the dictionary, you don't know how to look in alphabitical order and die of boredom from reading every single entry in the dictionary. You are later found with your head resting on the word "bored." </h5>
