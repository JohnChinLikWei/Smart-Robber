    <h3> Smart Robber is a game where you try to rob a rich man. Your decision decides your outcome. You win if you collect the giant diamond which is locked inside the rich man's safe and escape. This is a choose-you-own-adventure game. You are a robber equipped with the following: Flashlight, pistol (USP with 5 bullets), hammer, and axe. You drive a Toyota. </h3>
    <p>Tips (actually, I should remove the "s"): Try not to overthink the solution. Just click on what you would want to do. Usually a person would lose when they think there's a catch. Just use your brain.  </p>
